# Deep Neural Networks For Image Classification
The source code for this project has been presented in both .py and .ipynb files depending on your preference presented in the CodeFiles_py and Notebooks_ipynb directories respectively. These source codes were used to provide the results of the tables within the report and are put in folders according to which table they provide the results for. All results can be found in the Results_RunTimes folder.

Here is the abstract summarising the report:

> **Abstract—Deep Learning has been at the forefront of image classification tasks, dominating the field. VGG and GoogLeNet are two models which come to mind when approaching these problems of Computer Vision. In this report, both models arecritically discussed. Next, the models are tested on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, first the original architectures are replicated (as far as possible) bearing in mind the fact that VGG and GoogLeNet were both originally designed for classification of the ILSVRC dataset which contains many more samples and larger images. It is shown that MNIST keeps stability whereas CIFAR-10 often suffers from the vanishing gradient problem. After, modifications are made to both models, where we see the benefits of batch normalization with CIFAR-10 on instability. Other modifications are implemented such as smaller batch and stride sizes which prove to be important in the improvement of GoogLeNet on the mentioned datasets.**
