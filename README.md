# DeepNetworksForImageClassification
Presented in this repository are two deep neural networks, VGG and GoogLeNet to tackle the task of image classification on CIFAR- 10 and MNIST datasets. Alongside this is a in-depth written report showcasing the experimentation which was done in order to build the models.
